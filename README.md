# Bootstrap 4

### Difficult
- Working with images was a little difficult, I had to crop and scale the images to the same width and height so I was completely sure that they all were uniform.
- Figuring out how to use flexbox in coordination with Bootstrap 4 was at times difficult. In the end it helped me to see the importance of relation between parent and child elements and to see how I could troubleshoot my commands in real-time.
- The navbar was very difficult. Everything had to be exactly right for it to work and even though I followed a video step-by-step to try to get my dropdown to work, it failed. I eventually figured out that I was missing an element not mentioned in the video.
- I think the amount of `div` elements in a Bootstrap 4 file can get confusing in terms of placement. There are so many different elements in play by the time your page is fully designed, to keep track of where everything ends correctly can be confusing.


### Easy
- I used no CSS in this project and I am happy with the outcome. I really enjoyed making the layout and when I discovered how to use cards it became simple in general.
-Getting images into the cards and also laying a button on top was quite easy. I liked the preset buttons that were provided so everything can be done in HTML if you want.
- Making the navbar itself was relatively easy; the use of `ul` and `li` elements and adding links was very straightforward and easy to code.
- The initial setup of rows and columns was nicely organised and easy to work with. Having a skeleton essentially already ready for you on the page is a nice perk. You can customize it however you want and it's easy to do so.
